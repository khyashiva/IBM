BOX PLOTS
Because outliers are one of the primary reasons for resulting in a less accurate model.
The outlier detection and removing that I am going to perform is called IQR score technique.
Often outliers can be seen with visualizations using a box plot.

HISTORAM
frequency of occurrence of variables in an interval

HEAT MAPS
when we need to find the dependent variables.

SCATTERPLOT
to find the correlation between two variables
